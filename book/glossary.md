Intro

Checkpoint (Ethereum): the last block under consideration for finality for a given epoch.

Discouragement attack: an attack where an adversary burns resources to decrease payoff for others in the network.

Epoch (Ethereum): a length of time measured in blocks. As of today's specs, an epoch is 100 blocks and spans between two checkpoints.

Finality: The point at which a block has been decided upon by a client to never revert. In PoW rather there is no finality, only deeper block confirmations. 

Fork choice rule: the rules for traversing a dag in order to find the canonical chain.

Proof of work: a consensus mechanism where resources are burned to verify transactions. 

Proof of stake: a consensus mechanism where validators stake a number of tokens proportional to their voting power in finalizing blocks.
